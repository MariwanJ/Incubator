# Incubator
![Top](Top.png)
Incubator Using PID controller - Arduino Nano. 
The system consist of a design for eggs Turner. But the 3D printed holder or design is not included since there are many choices. 
Another arduino was used for the eggs-Turner. 
Feel free to modify, improve and send PR to my github. 

Note:

1-This project is made in 2020.

2-I added photo from the first version which I built and used. It is faulty.
  I added the photos to make it clear what were wrong. So when you check the new
  design you know that they are targeted and fixed. 
  
3-Updated to fix some other issues and add more footprint.
