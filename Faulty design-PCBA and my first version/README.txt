WARNING!!!! FAULTY PCB - DON'T USE (PHOTO IS FROM 1 VERSION)

My mistake in the first PCBA design:
1-Wrong footprint for the N-Channel Mosfet (pin 1, 2 swapped)
2-Wrong footprint for the regulator (5V regulator)
3-Wrong foot pring for the EEPROM (not the same packaging as the chip had)

Looking at the photo you see the work around the issue. 

I don't know why and how I made those mistakes :(
